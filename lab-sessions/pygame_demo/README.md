# Lab session 1

Navigate to the `lab-1` directory, where you will find the `main.py` script, then complete the following steps:

1. Review the code in the `main.py` script by following the slides at this link: [moving and bouncing the boxes](https://tur-learning.github.io/CIS1051-python/lectures/slides/05b_pygame_overview.slides.html#/6)
2. Add **comments** to the each section of the code and organize your code in blocks. Keep in mind that **comments** should be _meaningful_ and pertaining to the _functionalities_ of each code block.
3. Add the **collisions** between **Rect** objects in pygame. At the moment, the rectangles bounce back at the boundaries of the window, but they may overlap with each other. We want the rectangles to bounce also when they collide with another rectangle.
   Look at the [pygame doc](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) to find a way to deal with collisions. **Hint**: You could search for the word _collide_ or _collision_ in the doc page for [Rect](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html) objects in pygame.
