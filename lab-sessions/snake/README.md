# Challenge instructions

Move to the `challenge` directory and work out as many levels as you can.

For the moment, disregard the `game.py` module, where a bunch of functionalities, mainly related to the `pygame` module, were put together.

Look for the `#TODO` *tag* and there below put your own code. At the end, if you want to, compare the solution you found against the one into the `solution` directory.
